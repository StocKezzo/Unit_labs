<!--Practice Validating CSS. Choose a CSS external style sheet file to validate; perhaps
you have created one for your own website. Otherwise, use an external style sheet file that you worked with in this chapter. Use the W3C CSS validator at http://jigsaw.w3.org/ css-validator. If your CSS does not immediately pass the validation test, modify it and test again. Repeat this process until the W3C validates your CSS code. Write a one- or two-paragraph summary about the validation process that answers the following questions: Was the CSS validator easy to use? Did anything surprise you? Did you encounter a number of errors or just a few? How easy was it to determine how to correct the CSS file? Would you recommend the validator to other students? Why or why not? -->

            <li>Remove the pork rind from the guanciale and cut it first into slices and then into strips about 1cm.</li>
            <li>Put all the strips into a non-stick pan and cook for about 15min over medium heat trying not to burn the guanciale which will result in a too strong smell.</li>
            <li>Put the spaghetti in boiling water and cook for the time indicated by the package.</li>
            <li>Put the yolks into a bowl and add most of the Pecorino cheese indicated for the recipe, with black pepper and salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Whip by hand forming a cream adding a tablespoon of cooking water to dilute the mixture.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta directly into the pan with the guanciale and stir it.</li>
            <li>Remove the heat and pour the mixture of eggs and pecorino into the pan. Mix quickly to combine.</li>
            <li>To make it very creamy you can add a little cooking water to your pasta.</li>
            <li>Serve <strong>immediately</strong> with the remaining pecorino cheese and groung black pepper on top.</li>
            <li><strong>ENJOY!</strong></li>
