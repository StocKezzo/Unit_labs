<!--7.	Practice with External Style Sheets. In this exercise, you will create two external style sheet files and a web page. You will experiment with linking the web page to the exter- nal style sheets and note how the display of the page is changed. 
a)	Create an external style sheet (call it format1.css) to format as follows: document background color of white, document text color of #000099, and document font family of Arial, Helvetica, or sans-serif. Hyperlinks should have a background color of gray (#CCCCCC). Configure the h1 selector to use the Times New Roman font with red text color. 
b)	Create an external style sheet (call it format2.css) to format as follows: document background color of yellow and document text color of green. Hyperlinks should have a background color of white. Configure the h1 selector to use the Times New Roman font with white background color and green text color. 
c)	Create a web page about your favorite movie that displays the movie name in an <h1> tag, a description of the movie in a paragraph, and an unordered (bulleted) list of the main actors and actresses in the movie. The page should also have a hyperlink to a website about the movie. Place an e-mail link to yourself on the web page. This page should be associated with the format1.css file. Save the page as moviecss1.html. Be sure to test your page in more than one browser. 
d)	Modify the moviecss1.html page to link to the format2.css external style sheet instead of the format1.css file. Save the page as moviecss2.html and test it in a browser. Notice how different the page looks!

        <p>In 2154, the natural resources of the Earth have been depleted. The Resources Development Administration (RDA) mines the valuable mineral unobtanium on Pandora, a moon in the Alpha Centauri star system. Pandora, whose atmosphere is inhospitable to humans, is inhabited by the Na'vi, 10-foot-tall (3.0 m), blue-skinned, sapient humanoids that live in harmony with nature. To explore Pandora, genetically matched human scientists use Na'vi-human hybrids called "avatars". </p>
